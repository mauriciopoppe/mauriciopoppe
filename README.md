### Hi there 👋, I'm Mauricio Poppe

I'm a Software Engineer passionate about infrastructure and data visualization. I enjoy learning new languages, recording song covers, and occasionally dancing bachata. I write about these topics and more on my website, [mauriciopoppe.com](https://mauriciopoppe.com).

#### Kubernetes

I am a member of the SIG storage and kubernetes-csi communities on GitHub.

I am currently working on a long-term plan to refactor the Kubernetes storage codebase into a monorepo. This effort involves collaboration with engineers from several companies (including Alibaba, AWS, RedHat, VMware). More details can be found in the [KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/5153).

### Writing

I've been writing notes since 2015, originally focusing on algorithms, visualization, and web development. Lately, I've been interested in learning and writing about topics beyond technology, such as documenting my life through journaling and vlogs, learning languages like French and Japanese, and making music (especially playing and dancing Bachata).

### Talks

I have given several public talks and presentations, from frontend development to infrastructure development with deep dives into Kubernetes storage internals. Some highlights include speaking 2x at KubeCon about the intersection of Storage and Windows and about how I debug Kubernetes with delve.
